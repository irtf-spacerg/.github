# IRTF SPACERG  
**Systems and Protocol Aspects for Circumstellar Environments Research Group**

> To-be proposed research group.
> Exploring architecture and protocol challenges for the next generation of aerospace networks.

---

## üåå Scope & Motivation

**SPACERG** investigates systems and protocols for **aerospace networks** ‚Äî including satellites (LEO/MEO/GEO), HAPS, drones, and cislunar platforms. These environments pose unique challenges, such as:

- High-speed mobility and dynamic topologies  
- Harsh constraints on energy, computation, and bandwidth  
- Multi-operator interoperability and evolving architectures  
- Sustainability, lifecycle limitations, and global externalities

We aim to bridge the gap between siloed research and real-world, interoperable networking.

## üß† Focus Areas

- **Evaluation**: Standardized methods for simulation, emulation, and measurement  
- **Optimization**: Scheduling, routing, and data handling using models and ML  
- **Systems**: Architectures, control planes, and cross-domain interoperability  

Deliverables include: white papers, curated datasets, scripts, shared simulators, and evaluation baselines.

## ü§ù Community and Stakeholders

SPACERG collaborates across disciplines and institutions:

- **IETF/IRTF**: DTN WG, TIPTOP, TVR, PANRG, SUSTAIN RG  
- **External**: CCSDS, 3GPP, SIGCOMM, SIGMOBILE, satellite operators, and research labs

We foster cross-disciplinary dialogue, support open data, and build common methodologies.

## üß≠ Initial Goals

1. Curated repository of aerospace network datasets and scenarios  
2. Documentation of current methodologies and evaluation baselines  
3. Development of open tools, metrics, and LEOscope-style infrastructure  
4. Community-driven contributions to guide future IETF/IRTF work
